# dxvk_game_cache
These are some DXVK Game Cache Files for Steam & Co.
Practically they skip the DXVK cache building process and the resulting stuttering in game.

Paste the file in to the following directory ($HOME/.steam/steam/steamapps/shadercache/<GAMEID>)
  
- ### Attention!! - Its essential to enable Shader Pre Caching in Steam options
  
  

### Apex Legends (GAMEID: 1172470)
Mostly stutter-free, if not perfectly smooth.

### ELEX 2 (GAMEID: 900040)
Includes cache of 10 hours of playtime. Some areas/npcs/magical effects TBD.
